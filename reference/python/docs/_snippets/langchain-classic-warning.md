!!! danger "LEGACY DOCUMENTATION"

    These docs cover the legacy `langchain-classic` package. This package is no longer actively maintained, barring security vulnerabilities. Users are strongly encouraged to migrate to the primary [`langchain`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) package for the latest features and improvements. [See docs for `langchain`](/python/langchain/langchain)
